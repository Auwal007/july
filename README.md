## AI in Career Development and Nigerian Graduate Employability

Graduate unemployment is a significant challenge in Nigeria. Factors such as skill-job misalignment, lack of practical experience, inadequate career guidance, and disconnect between academic curriculum and industry needs contribute to high unemployment rates among Nigerian graduates.

Artificial Intelligence, particularly through conversational career assessment tools, offers a powerful approach to address these issues. By providing personalized analysis of graduate skills and career potential, AI enables:

- **Personalized Skill Assessment**: Deep understanding of individual graduate capabilities through intelligent conversations
- **Gap Identification**: Precise identification of missing skills required for employment in specific fields
- **Tailored Development Plans**: Custom learning paths and project recommendations based on individual needs
- **Market Alignment**: Insights into Nigerian job market demands and opportunities
- **Career Clarity**: Helping graduates understand their potential and optimal career paths

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is a comprehensive demo project. A real-world robust career assessment system would benefit from integration with:
> - Live job market data APIs
> - University partnership systems
> - Employer feedback mechanisms
> - Continuous learning algorithms
> - Regional economic indicators
> - Industry-specific skill databases

This demo serves as a **proof-of-concept** for the valuable role AI can play in building a more employable workforce for Nigeria.
